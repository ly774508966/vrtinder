a new way to fall in love  
=========================

Card-board of swiping your thumb back and forth all day? Stagnant dating life? If you answered yes or no to any of those questions, then our new match-making invention is the thing for you. 100% satisfaction guaranteed! Set things into motion today and improve your chances of finding "the one" by leaps and bounds. Our team of almost 5 engineers worked tirelessly with only limited breaks for nearly 12 hours to bring your romantic fantasies into reality.  

Tip: To get the full "searching for love" experience, set your gaze onto the person and press the trigger on the top of the viewer.  

On a more serious note, this project is basically Leap Motion + Google Cardboard + Tinder. You use Tinder through the Cardboard viewer and interact with the app by, you guessed it, swiping left and right on the Leap Motion. Given our limited time, we were mostly concerned about facilitating the communication between the Leap Motion and the phone/Cardboard app so we relied on a modified version of the Cardboard demo for Unity for the display/viewing environment. To get started, run the app on the phone (it will stick on the Unity splash screen and wait for the Leap motion to connect) and then run the swipe listener from the device running the Leap Motion.  

Use sample\_device.py in cardboard/ to test and monitor the swipe listener. You can communicate across devices by setting the appropriate address field in the sockets.
